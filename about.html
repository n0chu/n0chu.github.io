                Hi, my name is Ina.
            </h1>
            <p>
                I'm an intermediate programmer from Canada who graduated with a Computer Engineering Technology degree and have experience using the following
                programming languages: C#, SQL, HTML, ASP.NET, PHP, Ajax, JavaScript, jQuery, C, FileMaker Pro. 
                Additionally, I am proficient at utilizing Microsoft applications (like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Visio,
                OneDrive, Teams and SharePoint), as well as Google applications, Photoshop, operating systems and driver installations.
                I've developed strong customer service skills through my previous work experiences and have built and collaborated
                on projects that have helped me retain and improve my skills.
                <br><br>
                <!-- Utilizing programming and technology has helped me express myself through my hobbies. For example:
                I have made mini games in honor of my love for gaming; I've learned to edit videos and music;
                and I've made websites for blogs, shops and for personal use. 
                <br><br> -->
                I am passionate in enriching my personal life with the skills I have acquired from my profession. For example:
                I developed mini games in honor of my love for gaming; I have learned to use my technical skills for editing videos and music;
                and I created websites and designed blogs, shops and for personal use.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, I believe that when combined with my passion and skills I can be an asset to the team and company.
